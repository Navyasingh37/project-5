            <h2>why is home is important????</h2>
            <img src="home.2.jpeg">
            <p><I><b>e it ever so humble, there’s no place like home.” “Home is where the heart is.” These well-known
                        expressions indicate
                        that home is somewhere that is both desirable and that exists in the mind’s eye as much as in a
                        particular physical
                        location. Across cultures and over the centuries people of varied means have made homes for
                        themselves and for those
                        they care about. Humans have clearly evolved to be home builders, homemakers, and home-nesters.
                        Dwellings that are
                        recognizable as homes have been found everywhere that archaeologists and anthropologists have
                        looked, representing every
                        era of history and prehistory.

                        Home has always been a gathering place, shelter, and sanctuary, providing escape from the
                        busyness and intrusiveness of
                        the world. Much thought about, treasured, and longed for as an anchor of our existence, home has
                        been the subject of
                        abundant written works and other cultural products. We might reasonably suppose, therefore, that
                        home is a readily
                        understood concept and source of universally positive feelings. On closer investigation,
                        however, neither of these
                        assumptions is found to be true. The concept of home is constructed differently by different
                        languages; dwellings are
                        built and lived in very differently by diverse groups; and many individuals have negative or
                        mixed emotions in regard to
                        their experiences of home life. To embrace all of the nuances of meaning, outlook, lifestyle,
                        and feeling that attach to
                        home is a daunting task, but it greatly enriches our perspective on the world.</b></I></p>
